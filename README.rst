Python library for geodetic network adjustment using the least square adjustment defined by the Gauss-Markov model. The project is still in alpha so features may be missing and there may be many changes between versions.


Description
===========

The functional model is built using the parametric adjustment. Currently supported networks are:

* 1D with height differences
* 2D with distances, directions and angles
